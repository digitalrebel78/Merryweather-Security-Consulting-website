            <p id="p1" class="text t-line">You wake up with first light and step outside, lighting a cigarette and work through the cobwebs from last night`s whiskey knife fight. It`s a barmy 120 degrees, not a cloud in the sky. You sip a cup of fresh coffee, pulling another cigarette from your (tax free!) pack while watching the sun rise over the snow-capped mountains in the distance. Two local village elders come over the ridge leading a herd of goats. They`re laughing, the goats` bells are ringing. They cast a glance in your direction. You stub out your cigarette in the sand, crack your neck, and release the safety on your rifle. Because you`re a Merryweather man. And a Merryweather man never thinks twice...</p>

                Are you an unhinged ex-soldier or a power-crazed police officer? Or maybe an existing soldier who wants to quadruple his salary while freeing himself from the restrictive drug and alcohol policies of the US Armed Forces?
                <br />
                Or just a gun nut who`s always dreamed of being able to mow down strangers with impunity?

            <h3 class="text">Merryweather wants to hear from you.</h3>
            <p id="p3" class="text t-line">We offer an extremely competitive salary and benefits package, plus designer sunglasses and a uniform with a reinforced crotch so that you can spit ad many times a day ad you want to.</p>
